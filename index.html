      <h2>News Localization Engine:</h2>
      <p>With Northwestern's Knight Lab, I developed a NLE that would allow journalists to create hundreds of unique local articles by taking a national news article giving it a local angle by using datasets and natural language generation. We used a templating library in Python called Jinja to generate a unique paragraph of text with local facts from datasets. We then used an API to find the visitor's location, and based on the FIPS code of their region we included the local angle into the news article. </p>
